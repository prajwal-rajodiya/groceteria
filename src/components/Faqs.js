            <h5>There is a difference in the amount mentioned in the invoice sent by the store and the order value shown by groceteria when placing the order. Why should I pay the extra amount?</h5>
            <p>
            Fruits and Vegetables are natural products that come in different shapes and sizes. While we have a strict control on the average sizes and weights, there is always scope for weight to vary from your ordered quantity. As a process we make sure that in all conditions only a maximum of one unit can go extra and hence you will be changed for the extra unit quantity.
