                    Fresh fruits and vegetables are hand picked, hand cleaned
                    and hand packed in reusable plastic trays covered with
                    cling. We ensure hygienic and careful handling of all our

                  <h5>How are the fruits and vegetables weighed?</h5>
                  <p>
                    Every fruit and vegetable varies a little in size and
                    weight. While you shop we show an estimated weight and price
                    for everything priced by kilogram. At the time of delivery
                    we weigh each item to determine final price. This could vary
                    by a maximum of one unit weight depending on the article. In
                    case the weight of the product is lesser than what you
                    ordered, you will pay correspondingly less.

                    on the average sizes and weights, there is always scope for
                    weight to vary from your ordered quantity. As a process we
                    make sure that in all conditions only a maximum of one unit
                    can go extra and hence you will be changed for the extra
                    unit quantity.
